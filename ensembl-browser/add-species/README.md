# Adding an additional species to the docker demo website

This Docker file is the same as the main docker demo, but adds another plugin `public-plugins/docker-demo-add-species` on top. 

The plugin adds species _Anopheles gambaie_ to the site.

Build and run as per the main demo.

Once the image is running, _Anopheles gambaie_ should appear on the homepage and be available at http://your-server/Anopheles_gambiae
