## Additional species example

This example shows how to configure an Ensembl instance to include an additional species, in this case *Anopheles gambaie*.

The demo instance is configured to use the public Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes MySQL servers for the genomic data and will create a local dockerised MySQL server for the session database.   

To run the demo:
1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Browse http://localhost:8000
